Version: 0.1
Purpose: To review my knowledge that I learned about using various verifiers
to be able to analyze data sets, and also to enhance my knowledge about the 
concepts of machine learning. 

5th May 2015
* Revisiting this project after a while to brush up on various things
* Also to further develop this code to be more readable, usable, etc... 
* Added a new class - ManhattanDistance.cs to implement the basic steps that are involved with the Manhattan verifier
* Having various things be done like printing out the data, and all. 
* Editing the Manhattan Verifier class such that it will print the original data, then calculate the average vector.

* Making more code regions possible - that way this code is not only readable, but understandable. 
* Having more annotations, methods in the ManhattanDistance class file. 
* Making further method calls.
