Version: 0.1
Purpose: To review my knowledge that I learned about using various verifiers
to be able to analyze data sets, and also to enhance my knowledge about the 
concepts of machine learning. 

5th May 2015
* Revisiting this project after a while to brush up on various things
* Also to further develop this code to be more readable, usable, etc... 
* Added a new class - ManhattanDistance.cs to implement the basic steps that are involved with the Manhattan verifier
* Having various things be done like printing out the data, and all. 
* Editing the Manhattan Verifier class such that it will print the original data, then calculate the average vector.  

6th May 2015
* Making more code regions possible - that way this code is not only readable, but understandable. 
* Having more annotations, methods in the ManhattanDistance class file. 
* Making further method calls. 
* Adding more user functionality so that the end user can be able to see which verifier to use and therefore see the results. 
* Now creating the data structures for the additional data files which I just imported.  

11th May 2015
* Having a DataFiltering class with one method to really make sure that we put in a text file, 
get out a 2D double array. 
* Adding in the various comments and made sure that everything still makes sense. 

12 May 2015
* Adding in more user data, and right now, having all of the user data entered into the solution is most important thing to get done
* Also to format the txt files and save them as csv files also is an important aspect to making this work

13th May 2015
* Going to add more users to this solution
* Review the in-code documentation that is currently written and edit that.
* After that will be writing the method to calculate the genuine scores which is part of the process for the Manhattan Verifier.

23rd May 2015
* Reviewing the written code and catching up to speed.
* Finishing up the genuine score calculation method.
* Also keeping up with the changelog.

27th May 2015
* Adding more user data - users 10 through 12, the CSV files.  In code will be done later. 
* Making more progress with regards to the ManhattanDistance class. 
* Also making sure to understand the EuclideanDistance verifier via examples and also then will be 
planning out the pseudocode for it as well.
