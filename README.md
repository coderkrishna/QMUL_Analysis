QMUL_Analysis
=============

Analysis of 100 users typing a fixed text.  Experiments were conducted at Queen Mary Univeristy in London, and I will be analyzing only the latencies of each user.  I will take the original text file, and create CSV files from them, and I will then analyze the results when I use the Manhattan Verifier.
