QMUL Analysis
=============

Analysis of 100 users typing a fixed text.  Experiments were conducted at Queen Mary Univeristy in London, and I will be analyzing only the latencies of each user.  I will take the original text file, and create CSV files from them, and I will then analyze the results when I use various verifiers. 

Verifiers Used
==============
1. Manhattan Verifier - This verifier, I have learned about before and will be using it as my first option
2. Euclidean Verifier - This verifier I will learn about on my own time, and then will write another C# class to be able to properly utilize this verifier. 
3. Scaled Manhattan Verifier - Difference with this verifier is that the Scaled Manhattan Verifier will have the Standard Deviation of the data in the denominator
4. Scaled Euclidean Verifier - Difference with this again, you are using the Euclidean Verifier but then again underneath the square root, you will have in the denominator, the standard deviation of the data that is being analyzed.

Reasons Why I Created
=========
The following are reasons why I have created this sample project:
* To further practice my C# coding skills - To properly implement the concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
* To be able to understand the development of reusable code
* To also dive deeper with the concepts behind keystroke dynamics to properly enable the understanding of various verifiers that are used throughout the industry
